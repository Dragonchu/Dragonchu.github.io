ARIES：Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics

support partial rollbacks of transactions

support fine-granularity(e.g. record) locking and recovery

support fuzzy checkpoints, selective and deferred restart, fuzzy image copies, media recovery, and high concurrency lock modes

使用write-ahead logging(WAL)

*repeating history →* redo all missing update before performing the rollbacks of the the loser transactions during restart after a system failure

a log sequence number in each page → correlate the state of a page with respect to logged updates of that page
